# Singleton Design Pattern

## Definition

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global point of access to this instance.

## Description

In software engineering, the Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

The Singleton pattern is implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. If an instance already exists, it simply returns a reference to that object. To ensure that the object cannot be instantiated any other way, the constructor is made private. The class can also provide a way to access the singleton instance through a static method that returns a reference to the instance.

## Usage

Singleton pattern is mostly used in multithreaded and database applications. It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.

## Pros

The Singleton pattern has several benefits, including:
- **Single instance:** Only one instance of the class is created, which ensures that the class is not duplicated unnecessarily.
- **Global access:** The single instance can be accessed from anywhere in the code, which makes it easy to use and maintain.
- **Lazy initialization:** The singleton is only created when it is first accessed, which can improve performance.

## Cons

The Singleton pattern also has some drawbacks, including:
- **Global state:** The singleton object represents global state, which can make it difficult to reason about the behavior of the system.
- **Tight coupling:** The Singleton pattern can lead to tight coupling between classes, which can make it difficult to modify the system later on.
- **Testing difficulties:** Because the Singleton object is global, it can be difficult to write unit tests that isolate the behavior of individual classes.

## Types

There are three main types of Singleton pattern implementation:

- **Classic Singleton (Eager Singleton)** 
    - The classic Singleton implementation ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a global point of access to this instance. This type of Singleton is implemented by creating a private constructor, a private static instance variable, and a public static method that returns the instance. 
    - The Classic Singleton type is the most common and simple implementation of Singleton pattern. However, it is not thread-safe, which can lead to issues in multi-threaded environments.

- **Lazy Singleton**
    - The lazy Singleton implementation delays the creation of the singleton instance until it is actually needed, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
    - This type of Singleton is implemented by creating a private constructor and a private static instance variable, but without creating the instance variable until it is actually needed. The public static method that returns the instance creates the instance if it hasn't been created yet, and returns the existing instance if it has.
    - The Lazy Singleton type is useful in situations where the object creation is expensive or time-consuming, and where the object is not needed immediately. However, it is important to ensure that the Lazy Singleton is thread-safe, as the delayed creation can lead to issues in multi-threaded environments.

- **Thread-safe Singleton** 
    - The thread-safe Singleton implementation ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a global point of access to this instance, while also being safe for use in multi-threaded environments.
    - This type of Singleton is implemented using techniques such as double-checked locking, synchronized methods, or volatile variables to ensure that the instance is only created once and that it is safe for use in multi-threaded environments.
