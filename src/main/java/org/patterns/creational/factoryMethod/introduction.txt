    - The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    - This pattern is often used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. To accomplish this, objects are created by calling a factory method instead of calling a constructor.

It solves the following two problems
-------------------------------------
    - Defining a separate object creation method in the form of a factory
    - Allowing subclasses to call factory for object creation
